# distances
This Lua module calculates the "infinite distance" between two sprites and detects the collision between them. Integration of the following specific distance cases: Manhattan distance (K distance with k = 1), Euclidean distance (K distance with k = 2), K distance (with k > 2). Integration of scale factors a and b for sprites.
